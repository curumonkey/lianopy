# 🌿 Lianopy

### 🙈🍌 “Ooo‑oooh, welcome to my jungle! 

I’m just a curious monkey, and I’ve found this clever thing called Lianopy. You know how we monkeys swing from liana to liana high up in the canopy? Well, that’s the idea here!

Instead of bananas, we’re sharing files — swinging them safely from one canopy to another through digital vines.

---

+ 🐒 Stateless & cross‑platform → works anywhere, no heavy baggage.

+ 🌐 CLI + Web interface → easy to start from the ground or the treetops.

+ 📱 QR code onboarding → just point, scan, and swing right in.

+ ⚡ Responsive UI & secure storage → smooth like a monkey’s swing, safe like a sturdy branch.

So when you run Lianopy, you’re not just starting a server — you’re opening a jungle bridge, letting others climb across and grab what they need. From canopy to canopy, vine to vine, the jungle stays connected.” 🌴
